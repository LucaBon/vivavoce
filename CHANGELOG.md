# Changelog

## Unreleased

### New

- **Vague requests now play something, and say what.** «metti qualcosa di
  rilassante», «musica per cena», «metti un po' di jazz» / "play something
  relaxing", "play some music for dinner" used to be searched for as if they
  were song titles, and of course nothing was ever called that. They now
  resolve through your library's own genres first — real music you own — and
  fall back to the streaming service's curated playlists only when the library
  has nothing to offer; asking for your own library keeps the answer local.
  The load asks LMS for a random album order, so a mood does not open on the
  same track every evening — it is the album order that is randomised, not the
  tracks inside an album, and it is scoped to that one request: your player's
  own shuffle setting is never touched.

  It also answers the axes your library already tags: **a decade** («metti
  musica anni ottanta» / "play some eighties music" — one year out of it, said
  out loud, and «un'altra» gives another year of the same decade), **Christmas
  music**, **instrumental** / "without words", and **summery**. A decade the
  library has nothing from says so rather than playing the nearest thing.

  Every reply reads back what it started («Ho messo un po' di Ambient») and
  invites «un'altra» / "another one", which picks something different until
  the ideas run out and it says so. Choosing is only allowed here because
  nothing was named: a request that names a song, an album or an artist is
  untouched — «metti Bollicine di Vasco» behaves exactly as before, and so
  does a song whose title happens to be a mood word. Still deterministic,
  still no model anywhere: a lookup table and your library's metadata.

- **The container image is published**, so "Docker — one command" is finally
  one command: `docker run … ghcr.io/lucabon/vivavoce:latest`, no clone and no
  build. Every release tag publishes for **amd64 and arm64** as `:X.Y.Z`,
  `:X.Y` and `:latest`. Building from a checkout is unchanged — the compose
  file in the repo still builds from source, with the published image as a
  commented alternative — and a 32-bit Raspberry Pi still builds its own, which
  DEPLOY.md now says instead of implying otherwise.

- **Guided certificate setup.** The mic needs HTTPS, so the browser's "your
  connection is not private" warning stood exactly in front of the feature
  people pay for. The *"Installa come app"* panel now recognises that state and
  opens by itself, shows the two steps for **your** device only (Android,
  iPhone/iPad, Windows, macOS, Linux — the others are one tap away for when you
  are setting up a phone from a laptop), and checks by itself that it worked.
  The check is not a guess: a browser refuses to register a service worker on
  an untrusted certificate, so a registration that succeeds *is* the proof the
  CA is installed. It also knows the cases where there is nothing to do —
  you are on the server machine, the server serves plain HTTP, or it uses a
  certificate of its own — and asks for nothing in each. DEPLOY.md additionally
  documents the ACME/DNS-01 route for households that own a domain and would
  rather install nothing on any device.

- **14 days of full Pro on every install**, microphone included — no key, no
  card, no account, and no network call: the window is one timestamp in the
  data directory, opened the first time the server starts. Because it lives
  server-side it also unlocks the features enforced there (local speech
  recognition, server-side wake word), and clearing the browser's storage does
  not re-arm it. When it ends, typed commands keep working exactly as before —
  nothing breaks, nothing is deleted. The settings panel says how many days
  are left rather than claiming a license nobody bought, and after a command
  you typed, the page points out — at most once per session, and never in the
  first two days — that you could have simply said it.
- **Queue management** (free): «aggiungi X alla coda» / "add X to the queue"
  queues a song at the end; «metti X dopo questa» / "play X next" queues it
  right after the current track; «svuota la coda» / "clear the queue"; «cosa
  c'è in coda» / "what's in the queue" reads back what's coming up. Reuses
  the existing title/artist parsing and "did you mean" disambiguation — a
  queue command that opens a numbered list queues (not plays) whichever one
  you pick — and works with multi-room («aggiungi X alla coda in cucina»).
- **Favorites & radio** (free): «riproduci i preferiti» / "play my favorites"
  plays a saved LMS favorite; «metti la radio X» / "play the radio X"
  searches your favorites for a matching station name. Built on the LMS core
  Favorites API (not a specific radio plugin), so it works with however you
  already saved your stations — TuneIn, a plugin, or a raw stream URL.
- **Server-side wake word** (Pro, optional install — `uv sync --group
  wakeword`, its own group, see DEPLOY.md): an alternative to the browser's
  continuous-listening mode that eliminates the Android beep — the single
  most-cited launch complaint — by streaming mic audio to the server, which
  runs openWakeWord (CPU, no GPU) instead of restarting Web Speech every few
  seconds. Trade-off, upfront: only a fixed English phrase ("hey jarvis")
  today, not the free-text wake word — offered as an *additional* choice
  next to it, not a replacement. A new settings switch appears once the
  server reports the engine installed.
- **"Report a misunderstood phrase"** (free, privacy-first): when a command
  isn't understood, the reply offers a button that saves the report on your
  device and opens a pre-filled GitHub issue (phrase, language, source,
  version) for you to review and submit. Nothing is ever sent by the app
  itself — see PRIVACY.md.

### Fixed

- **`/command`, `/kidsafe`, `/player` and `/license` no longer drop the
  connection on a non-object JSON body** (`null`, a bare number, a string, a
  list): `json.loads` accepted it without raising, and the unguarded
  `.get(...)` that followed crashed with an uncaught `AttributeError`,
  contradicting each endpoint's own "never a 5xx" design — on `/license`,
  the one endpoint that handles a paid key. Pre-existing (found during a
  post-phase review of the Fase 1 diff, not introduced by it); now covered
  by tests on all four routes.

### Internal

- **The browser suite can no longer skip in silence.** `playwright install`
  exits 0 when it fails — it prints "Failed to install browsers" and returns
  success — so a broken install left a green CI job in which every browser test
  had skipped, which is exactly what had been happening locally. CI now sets
  `VIVAVOCE_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1`, under which those skips become failures, proves
  a browser really launches instead of trusting the installer's exit code, and
  falls back to `PLAYWRIGHT_HOST_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE` on platforms Playwright
  does not recognise yet (Ubuntu 26.04 already refuses; `ubuntu-latest` will
  get there). Three packaging tests keep CI from quietly dropping any of it.
- **Frontend split**: the 1.700-line `index.html` is now a markup shell plus
  native ES modules (`localvoice/static/js/`) and a real stylesheet — no
  bundler, no new dependencies. The installed PWA refetches the shell once.
- **Browser end-to-end tests**: seven Playwright flows (page load, command
  round trip, "did you mean" tap, license activation, now-playing, the report
  button, settings persistence) run headless in CI against the same fake-LMS
  stack as the rest of the suite.
- **Plug-in languages**: the router's IT/EN patterns moved into per-language
  packs (`localvoice/lang/`); adding a language is now one file plus its
  messages and tests — groundwork for German.
- **Server split**: `server.py` (startup/CLI) now stands apart from
  `http_api.py` (routes), `staticfiles.py` (assets) and `tls.py`;
  `python -m localvoice` works as a second entry point.

## 0.2.0 — August 2026

### SqueezeSay is now Vivavoce

The project is renamed **Vivavoce** (Italian for "hands-free / speakerphone").
"Squeeze-" echoed the Logitech Squeezebox trademark — the same reason the LMS
project itself renamed to Lyrion. What this means for existing installs:

| You use | What to do |
|---|---|
| Docker compose | `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. The data volume keeps its old internal name on purpose: your certificate (and license, see below) survive. Container/service are now called `vivavoce`. |
| Env variables | New names are `VIVAVOCE_*`. The old `SQUEEZESAY_*` names keep working **for this release only**, printing a deprecation note. |
| Home Assistant add-on | The add-on slug changed, so the Supervisor sees a **new add-on**: uninstall the old "SqueezeSay" one, add the repo again (`https://github.com/LucaBon/vivavoce`) and install **Vivavoce**. The old `/data` is not migrated — you'll re-accept the certificate once and re-enter your license key (this consumes one of your 5 activations). |
| Windows autostart | Re-run `tools/install_autostart.ps1`; `tools/uninstall_autostart.ps1` cleans up both the old and the new task/firewall names. |
| systemd | The unit is now `deploy/vivavoce.service`. |
| Installed PWA | The app updates itself on the next online open; the icon label may show the old name until you reinstall it (cosmetic). |
| Wake word | The default is now "vivavoce"; if you had saved a custom wake word (including "impianto"), it is preserved. |

### New

- **Now-playing panel** (free): artwork, title/artist/album, play/pause lamp,
  transport buttons, a draggable seek bar and a **volume slider**, at the top
  of the page.
- **Multi-room** (Pro, `localvoice/pro/multiroom.py`): a "Dove suona la
  musica" selector appears in settings when the LMS has more than one player,
  and any command can target a room on the fly: «metti Time **in cucina**»,
  «pausa in salotto» ("play … in the kitchen"). A follow-up «metti la 2»
  keeps playing in that room. Enforced server-side, like kid-safe.
- **Sleep timer** (free): «spegni tra 30 minuti», «stop in half an hour»,
  «annulla il timer» — the LMS native sleep timer, armed by voice.
- **Local speech recognition** (Pro, `localvoice/pro/asr.py`, optional
  install): the mic can transcribe on *your* server with **faster-whisper**
  instead of the browser's cloud engine — the audio never leaves the LAN,
  closing the one non-local step in the privacy story. Enable with
  `uv sync --group asr` (or the Docker `--build-arg ASR=1` image) and flip
  «riconoscimento vocale locale» in settings; Web Speech remains the default
  and the automatic fallback. Model configurable with `--asr-model` /
  `VIVAVOCE_ASR_MODEL`, cached in the data directory; the default is
  RAM-aware — `small` on ~4 GB+ machines, off below that (the smaller models
  mangle English song titles; an explicit `--asr-model` always wins). As a
  bonus, the mic now also works on browsers without Web Speech (Firefox).
- **LMS status lamp** (free): the header LED turns red — with a clear message —
  when the music server is unreachable, instead of failing silently.
- **Vivavoce Pro** — one-time license (11,90 €; launch price 8,90 €) that
  unlocks the microphone, the wake word, the multilingual read-back voices and
  kid-safe. Activation is once-online, then cached: offline never disables it.
  The core stays free (text commands, all search/playback, transport) and is
  now formally **AGPL-3.0** (the repo previously had no license).
- **Kid-safe on the web app** (Pro): PIN-protected blocklist, enforced
  server-side for every device on the LAN, editable by voice («blocca …»,
  «sblocca …», «quali brani sono bloccati») or from settings.
- **Auto-discovery from inside Docker bridge/NAT** (free): when the UDP
  broadcast can't leave the container (Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac, bridge
  networks), the server now falls back to a **unicast sweep** of the LAN — LMS
  answers the same discovery request sent host-by-host — and remembers the
  server in the data volume, so restarts skip discovery entirely.
  `docker compose up` is zero-config everywhere, not just with host networking.

### Removed

- **The Alexa skill.** It required an always-on HTTPS tunnel and a developer
  account per household — unmaintainable, and the web app does the job
  without any cloud. The engine lives on under `engine/` (was `lambda/`).

### Internal

- **CI** (GitHub Actions): every push and pull request runs the test suite on
  Python 3.9–3.14 plus a Windows job (the `%APPDATA%` data-directory branch a
  Linux-only matrix never executes), byte-compiles every module — `tools/` is
  imported by no test, so a syntax error there used to reach the user — and
  builds the Docker image, which is the only thing that catches a `COPY`
  pointing at a moved file.
- **Integration tests** (489 → 531): the PWA shell (`sw.js` pre-caches its
  asset list atomically, so a single 404 silently stopped the app being
  installable), the `/command` path end-to-end from HTTP down to the commands
  the LMS actually receives, and the release descriptors — the add-on version
  must match `pyproject.toml`, and every Dockerfile `COPY` source must exist.
