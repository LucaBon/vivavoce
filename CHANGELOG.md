# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — July 2026

### SqueezeSay is now Vivavoce

The project is renamed **Vivavoce** (Italian for "hands-free / speakerphone").
"Squeeze-" echoed the Logitech Squeezebox trademark — the same reason the LMS
project itself renamed to Lyrion. What this means for existing installs:

| You use | What to do |
|---|---|
| Docker compose | `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. The data volume keeps its old internal name on purpose: your certificate (and license, see below) survive. Container/service are now called `vivavoce`. |
| Env variables | New names are `VIVAVOCE_*`. The old `SQUEEZESAY_*` names keep working **for this release only**, printing a deprecation note. |
| Home Assistant add-on | The add-on slug changed, so the Supervisor sees a **new add-on**: uninstall the old "SqueezeSay" one, add the repo again (`https://github.com/LucaBon/vivavoce`) and install **Vivavoce**. The old `/data` is not migrated — you'll re-accept the certificate once and re-enter your license key (this consumes one of your 5 activations). |
| Windows autostart | Re-run `tools/install_autostart.ps1`; `tools/uninstall_autostart.ps1` cleans up both the old and the new task/firewall names. |
| systemd | The unit is now `deploy/vivavoce.service`. |
| Installed PWA | The app updates itself on the next online open; the icon label may show the old name until you reinstall it (cosmetic). |
| Wake word | The default is now "vivavoce"; if you had saved a custom wake word (including "impianto"), it is preserved. |

### New

- **Now-playing panel** (free): artwork, title/artist/album, play/pause lamp,
  transport buttons, a draggable seek bar and a **volume slider**, at the top
  of the page.
- **Multi-room** (Pro, `localvoice/pro/multiroom.py`): a "Dove suona la
  musica" selector appears in settings when the LMS has more than one player,
  and any command can target a room on the fly: «metti Time **in cucina**»,
  «pausa in salotto» ("play … in the kitchen"). A follow-up «metti la 2»
  keeps playing in that room. Enforced server-side, like kid-safe.
- **Sleep timer** (free): «spegni tra 30 minuti», «stop in half an hour»,
  «annulla il timer» — the LMS native sleep timer, armed by voice.
- **Local speech recognition** (Pro, `localvoice/pro/asr.py`, optional
  install): the mic can transcribe on *your* server with **faster-whisper**
  instead of the browser's cloud engine — the audio never leaves the LAN,
  closing the one non-local step in the privacy story. Enable with
  `uv sync --group asr` (or the Docker `--build-arg ASR=1` image) and flip
  «riconoscimento vocale locale» in settings; Web Speech remains the default
  and the automatic fallback. Model configurable with `--asr-model` /
  `VIVAVOCE_ASR_MODEL` (default `small`), cached in the data directory. As a
  bonus, the mic now also works on browsers without Web Speech (Firefox).
- **LMS status lamp** (free): the header LED turns red — with a clear message —
  when the music server is unreachable, instead of failing silently.
- **Vivavoce Pro** — one-time license (11,90 €; launch price 8,90 €) that
  unlocks the microphone, the wake word, the multilingual read-back voices and
  kid-safe. Activation is once-online, then cached: offline never disables it.
  The core stays free (text commands, all search/playback, transport) and is
  now formally **AGPL-3.0** (the repo previously had no license).
- **Kid-safe on the web app** (Pro): PIN-protected blocklist, enforced
  server-side for every device on the LAN, editable by voice («blocca …»,
  «sblocca …», «quali brani sono bloccati») or from settings.

### Removed

- **The Alexa skill.** It required an always-on HTTPS tunnel and a developer
  account per household — unmaintainable, and the web app does the job
  without any cloud. The engine lives on under `engine/` (was `lambda/`).
